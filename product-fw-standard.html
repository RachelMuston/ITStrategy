<div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p align="center"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
    <p>
This document <strong>does NOT</strong> attempt to explain all aspects of Product Management (such as vision setting, user research, and the different phases a product goes through in its life cycle).
These are well documented already, such as on <a href="https://www.pmi.org/disciplined-agile/process/product-management">PMI.org</a> and <a href="https://community.pdma.org/knowledgehub/home">PDMA.org</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Instead, this documents seeks to provide structure to ESDC Programs and IITB in the <strong>transition</strong> from project to product, <strong>within a Canadian federal government context</strong>.
    In particular, the methods to <strong>fund cross-functional and cross-branch product teams</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Directive and Standard strive to be as succinct and to the point as possible, without repeating rules in existing policy instruments that teams are expected to comply with (such as Financial and Security). To help the reader understand the rationale behind them and provide guidance in implementing them, <a href="/ITStrategy/product-fw-guidance.html">a Guidance document has been written</a>.

<h3 id="product-team-setup">Product Team Setup</h3>

<h4 id="software-development-work">Software Development Work</h4>

<p>Budgeting a cross-branch product team will require the Sponsoring Branch to also budget part of the IT work that can be directly attributed to the product. Indirect costs such as SSC hosting services are not included as they are pooled at the IITB level.</p>

<p>Software Development work that a Sponsoring Branch must budget includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software development labour (non salary and salary)</li>
  <li>Operating and managing labour (e.g. software bug fixes, patching, incident response). This budget depends on the operating support hours</li>
  <li>Public Cloud credits (if using public cloud services such as MS Azure to host software or use cloud providers software as a service)</li>
  <li>Software licences specific to the product team’s (e.g. a specialized proprietary software that the product team will purchase)
 Any specialized equipment, such as high performing laptops</li>
</ul>

<p>It is worth noting that indirect IT costs, such as relational databases, SSC virtual machines, IITB corporate services such as Document Upload, do not make up the software development work budget.</p>

<h4 id="product-teams-software-performance-metrics">Product Team’s Software Performance Metrics</h4>

<p>The following software performance metrics are produced by the product team to measure the effectiveness that working under a cross-functional product team has over continuous product improvements.
In particular, that the Product Manager and Product Owner take sufficient attention on the risks that creeping technical debt, team morale, and cyber security has on the overall quality and effectiveness of the product team.</p>

<p>The metrics are compiled and made available each month.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deployment Frequency</strong>: How often the product team successfully releases to production</li>
  <li><strong>Lead Time for Changes</strong>: The amount of time it takes a code commit to get into production (software pipeline delivery)</li>
  <li><strong>Change Failure Rate</strong>: The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production</li>
  <li><strong>Time to Restore Service</strong>: How long it takes the product team to recover from a failure in production</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="risk-register">Risk Register</h4>

<p>A risk and issue register is a document that documents risks related to the product(s) and the mitigation plan for each.
When a risk materializes, it changes itself into an issue that needs to be resolved.</p>

<p>The Risk Register may be used by as evidence that risk management is being performed by the product team.
The Risk Register is available to auditors on demand.</p>

<p>Each risks in the register contains, at minimum, the following element:</p>

<p>The Product’s Risk Register does not repeat risks from a Branch Risk Register (BRR) or the IT Security Risk Register (that rolls up to the BRR).
Instead, the Product’s Risk Register is to manage risks at the product level. Its content may be used to inform the grater BRR and IT Security Risk Register by rolling up multiple products’ risk registers.</p>

<p><strong>1.	Recitals</strong></p>
<p>
Whereas &lt;Branch A&gt; has the authority, capacity, and expertise to deliver &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt; as part of &lt;Program name XYZ&gt; and IITB has the authority, capacity, and expertise to develop, operate, host, and assess software against the Information Management and Information Technology (IM/IT) regulations of the Treasury Board (TB) Directive on Service and Digital and the TB Directive on Security Management, therefore IITB agrees to provide &lt;Branch A&gt; with IT staff that will be dedicated to &lt;Branch A&gt;'s delivery of &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt;.
</p>
<p>
&lt;Branch A&gt; will transfer an amount equal to &lt;$$$&gt; on a yearly basis to IITB. This amount will be used to staff IT personnel and pay public cloud hosting fees (if necessary).
</p>
<p>IITB will be consulted to estimate the yearly IT Budget.</p>

<p>The IT Staff will remain in IITB. Their performance assessment will reflect both &lt;Service Name XYZ&gt;'s  delivery and IITB's expectations.</p>

<p>The term “Product Team” in this document refers to the members of the team that will be formed by including the &lt;Branch A&gt;'s staff and the dedicated IITB staff, as documented using the IITB Directive on Product Management.</p>

<p><strong>2. Commencement and Duration</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement will commence on &lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt; and will be reviewed [each year, each 4 years, on YYYY-MM-DD]</p>

<p><strong>3. Mutual Vision, Strategy, and Outcomes</strong></p>

<p>[This section develops a common vision and associated business strategies to ensure the parties are aligned with the mutual vision and strategies as negotiations evolve. This section should identify the outcomes expected from the establishment of a relationship and their linkage to the business objectives of the department]</p>

<p>The move to Digital puts software as part of service delivery as the products enabling the service are more and more software-based. Some of those software-based products are exposed to service consumers (e.g. a website). The use of software brings new opportunities for rapid service improvements as interactions with software generates large amount of data. This data is insights that can be used for evidence-based decision making, to improve existing business processes, enhance user experience, and continuously address cyber security risks.</p>

<p>To capitalize on this opportunity, smaller and more continuous changes in software should be enabled and facilitated. Funding cross-functionally skilled “product teams” enables collaboration amongst the different expertise traditionally segregated in organizational charts.</p>

<p>[narrate how this will specifically benefit the Program and the services it delivers to Canadian. Recommend using the Programs Performance Information Profile's desired outcomes, ESDC's Service Strategy and its Service Target Operating Model, and using an agile approach of trying, evaluating, and course correcting to navigate ambiguity].</p>

<p><strong>4.	Purpose and Objectives</strong></p>

<p>[This section defines the specific intent of the service relationship being formed and the expected outcomes for all parties to the agreement. Should tie back to the Program's Performance Information Profile and it's target outcomes. In addition, IM/IT Cyber Security and technical debt risk remediation may be added for value co-creation between IITB and &lt;Branch A&gt;]</p>

<p>Projects initiated outside of the Product Team's circle, such as transformational agenda and legislation changes, still exist and are expected to engage with the Product Team's Head of Product to negotiate commitments and product team's capacity challenges.</p>

<p>Integrity rules in the use of public funds and in software delivery are expected to remain, such as release management and cyber security assessments. In that spirit, project management discipline, information management, and cyber threat modeling expertise is expected to be embedded in the product team and will be monitored by the behaviours expected to be manifested from complying with the IITB Directive on Product Management.</p>

<p><strong>5.	Reference to Supporting Documents of Related Agreements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>IITB Directive on Product Management</li>
<li>&lt;Program Name's PIP&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;Service Name's description&gt;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>6.	Scope</strong></p>

<p>The scope of this agreement resides in what services the dedicated IITB staff will provide to &lt;Branch A&gt;. These include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Developing software</li>
    <li>Operating and managing software (e.g. bug fixes, patching)</li>
    <li>Hosting software</li>
    <li>Providing advice on the risks and alignment to ESDC's Enterprise Architecture Target State</li>
    <li>Estimating IT budgets based on demands (requirements)</li>
    <li>Actively participating and collaborating with the whole Product Team</li>
    <li>Engaging with other IITB services, when need be, to obtain IM/IT advice or approvals (e.g. Architectural services, Release Management procedures, IT Security Assessments)</li>
</ul>

<p>Members of the product team are expected to comply with the IITB Directive on Product Management.</p>

<p><strong>7.	Fee Structure or Resource Pooling Arrangements</strong></p>

<p>The funding model will be based on the “Pooled resources model” where IITB and &lt;Branch A&gt; agree on an annual scope of work, resulting in Human Resources (IT staff) and Hosing Credit costs (if public cloud services are used).</p>

<p>The amount of IT fund transferred from &lt;Branch A&gt; to IITB should be estimated based on the number of software releases expected per year, and historical trends.</p>

<p>Expenditures of the IT funds received from &lt;Branch A&gt; to IITB will be costed to under the &lt;Program Name&gt;</p>

<p><strong>8.	Performance Targets and Reporting</strong></p>
