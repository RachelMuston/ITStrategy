Note: This Strategy is written in "Amazon 2-pager style" ([more information](https://writingcooperative.com/the-anatomy-of-an-amazon-6-pager-fc79f31a41c9)).

## 1) Introduction 👩‍🏫

This document aims to outline the global current state of the culture of "Working in the Open" and share our strategic plans to make it a reality at ESDC.
The ultimate goal is to improve employee satisfaction and productivity as a whole through collaboration.
Working in the Open is a proven global practice all around the world.
One common application of the concept is open source software (OSS) development.
For example, in the last 12 months (Sept. 2021), more than 800 individuals contributed code to the popular TensorFlow machine-learning OSS project.
Countless organizations, including governments, have reaped the benefits of this culture.

Considering the current context, our assumption is that overall employee motivation is low, or at least it's not very high.
The shaking changes of the pandemic, the lack of real life human interactions, and the uncertainty the future holds, among other things, contributed to this state of affairs.
In order to be a high-performing organization, we must act to reinvigorate our valuable employees.
We believe instilling a strong **Working in the Open** culture will greatly contribute toward this goal, with open source software development being the first focus of the transition.

And to top it off, this objective is already strongly encouraged by the GC (e.g., Minister's Mandate letters, Directive on Open Government, GC Digital Standards, Directive on Service and Digital)...
Let's get to work! 💪

## 2) Goals 🎯

- **Augment employee morale and productivity**: From XX% to YY% (ref. ZZ survey).
- **Facilitate contribution governance**: Publish, actively support and promote a lean process for employees to share internal projects publicly and contribute to external ones.
- **Increase contributions to OSS projects:** From YYYY to ZZZZ overall commits (incl. 3rd party projects).
- **Increase adoption of OSS**: From XX to YY projects used in production (as an outcome of increasingly Working in the Open)
- **Facilitate and grow OSS acquisitions**: From XX to WW (less) time spent on acquisition process, from YY% to ZZ% percentage of OSS acquisitions (compared to proprietary).
- **Grow the Canadian economy**: Share custom software development with citizens for reuse, and empower Canadian workers (and others) to easily contribute back (incl. through contracting). From WWW to XXX published projects. From YY to ZZ micro-acquisition opportunities posted.

## 3) Tenets 👍

*[What is a "tenet"?](https://medium.com/fact-of-the-day-1/tenets-at-amazon-a2bb8a56ae94)*

- **Aim for low barrier of entry** 🛴
- **Embrace calculated risks** 🧐
- **Celebrate successes and failures** 🎢
- **Keep an eternal desire to learn** 📚

## 4) State of the business 👀

ESDC is responsible for the largest collaborative OSS project led by the GC: The [Web Experience Toolkit](https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew/index-en.html) (WET), which is being used today on most GC Websites including Canada.ca.
Despite this achievement, only a minority of teams in IITB are working in the open (DTS, IT Strategy...).
One likely reason is that the process for employees to request approvals related to open source development activities is mostly unknown, and somewhat tedious when followed.
Working in the Open is unfortunately not a "normal" behaviour based on current processes and culture.
Overall, a general fatigue is felt among employees, and a lack of enthusiasm toward innovative endeavours.

## 5) Lessons learned 🤪

ESDC developed an official OSS Management Framework that is well aligned with this vision.
The main recommendation was to establish an OSS Program Office (or CoE) to lead the whole initiative.
The framework has been endorsed at ESDC EARB on March 16, 2021.
However, no further actions have been taken since then.
Also, ad hoc approvals have been given to some employees to share internal projects or contribute to external ones, but the practice is unknown by the high majority of workers.
Therefore, the potential benefits are far from being realized.

## 6) Strategic priorities 🎨

### 6.1) Establish Open Source Centre of Enablement (CoE) 📢

To realize the vision, a proper enabling environment is required to guide, inspire and drive change across the organization.
The pivotal point is the creation of an Open Source CoE, led by IITB, that has genuine organizational support, involving all branches within ESDC.
The initial composition includes 4 resources:

- **Program Manager and Compliance Officer** (CS-04) – Oversee the whole initiative and drive partnerships. 👩‍💼
- **Coordinator (Software Development)** (CS-03) – Ensure proper code consumption and contributions. 🧙‍♂️
- **Coordinator (Operations)** (CS-03) – Facilitate the integration of OSS in the IT environment. 👩‍🔧
- **Change Agent & Developer Relations** (CS-02) – Spur interest and enthusiasm within ESDC's developer community, and coordinate communications. 🤹‍♂️

### 6.2) Execute the Action Plan 🚀

The Open Source CoE will execute the Action Plan, in collaboration with the rest of the organization:

- Organize hackathons and workshops to inspire staff
- Outreach to communities
- Empower employees with the right tools and platforms
- Leverage and contribute to software repositories (internal and external)
- Promote [inner source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source)
- Adjust internal IT governance and processes (e.g., transition to being Open by Default)
- Seek and manage sustainable funding of relevant open projects
- Ensure best security practices for adopted OSS components
- Manage change planning and communications

It is expected that these actions will gradually improve ESDC's maturity in Working in the Open, and will generate substantial benefits on its workforce and mandate.

Let's remember, it's not a sprint, it's a marathon. 🏃‍♀️
We deeply believe even a small improvement to ESDC's overall culture can have a huge positive ripple effect over time on the whole organization.
Let's go at it, and have fun along the way! 🎉
